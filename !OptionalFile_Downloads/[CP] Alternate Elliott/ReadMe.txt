This documentation is for users who want to use a matching Random Flower Queen portrait. You will need to know how to rename files and move files.


Step 1. Go to [CP] Alternate Elliott\Portraits\RandomFlowerQueen

Step 2. Select which version you want: Elliott_RFQ_{{VERSION_NAME}}

Step 3. Rename the chosen file to Elliott_RFQ. Keep this folder open or move the renamed file elsewhere. You will need it later.

Step 4. Go to [CP] Seasonal Villager Outfits\Portraits\RandomFlowerQueen

Step 5. Move your renamed Elliott_RFQ file to [CP] Seasonal Villager Outfits\Portraits\RandomFlowerQueen. You can drag + drop, cut, or copy + paste. Let it override the existing Elliott_RFQ

These steps will need to be redone every time SVO updates unless you keep a backup of your RandomFlowerQueen folder.
